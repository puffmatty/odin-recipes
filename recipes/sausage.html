            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This simple and delicious one-pan sausage and peppers 
                    recipe has been used in our family for years and years 
                    now. Serve in a roll, or use as a topping for pizza 
                    or pasta. For an extra kick, try using 1/2 sweet 
                    Italian sausage and 1/2 hot sausage!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 (4 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
                    <li>½ medium red onion, sliced</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 medium green bell pepper, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>¼ cup white wine, or more to taste</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat 
                        until brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove 
                        from skillet, and slice.</li>
                    <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Stir in onions 
                        and garlic, and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in bell 
                        peppers, season with basil and oregano, and stir 
                        in 1/4 cup wine. Continue to cook and stir until 
                        peppers and onions are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Return sausage slices to the skillet. Reduce heat 
                        to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, or until 
                        sausage is heated through, adding more wine if 
                        needed.</li>
                </ol>
