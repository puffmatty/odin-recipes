            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This Italian meatball recipe is very easy to make, 
                    and since we skip the messy step of pan-frying the 
                    meatballs, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a 
                    standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the 
                    meatballs are baked, add them to your favorite 
                    prepared tomato sauce and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>½ cup milk</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly 
                        with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a 
                        small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium 
                        heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has 
                        softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                        Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and 
                        stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 
                        minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large 
                        bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, 
                        Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black 
                        pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in 
                        diameter; arrange in a single layer on the 
                        prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and 
                        cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
