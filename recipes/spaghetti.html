            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one 
                    is pretty true to the classic method. The key is 
                    slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden 
                    brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't 
                    get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets 
                    bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
